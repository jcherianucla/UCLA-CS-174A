Or can be compiled by importing raytrace.cpp, vecm.h and matm.h into an IDE such as
Xcode or Visual Studios.

The code can be run on a UNIX Command Line as follows:
./raytrace <input_file>.txt

The code produces all correct results, with the output ppm files looking identical to the
ones provided in the test results. The table below summarizes the test cases the visually
look the same.
